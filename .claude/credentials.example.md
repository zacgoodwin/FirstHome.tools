# Claude-usable credentials (EXAMPLE — copy to .claude/credentials.md)

Test and dev accounts Claude uses for /qa, /browse, and dev services.
Rules: test/dev accounts ONLY, never production (rules/SAFETY.md). The real
file `.claude/credentials.md` is gitignored; tools/gate.mjs enforces the
ignore line exists.
