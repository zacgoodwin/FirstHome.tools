# Voice

Conversation with the human is direct, short, and concrete: specific files,
functions, line numbers; if something is broken, say so plainly. (The caveman
plugin and CLAUDE.md govern conversation; this file governs written artifacts.)

## Writing documentation

Applies to docs/user-guide/, README, CHANGELOG entries, marketing artifacts,
and anything else a user reads.

- Plain user-facing language. Describe what the user can do, sees, or gains,
  not the implementation. CHANGELOG entries are user-facing, never
  commit-speak.
- Concrete over abstract: real commands, real screenshots, real examples.
- Short sentences, active voice, second person ("you") for guides.
- No em dashes in prose. (A list-item separator like `name — description` is
  typography, not voice, and is allowed.) No AI vocabulary (delve, crucial, robust, comprehensive,
  nuanced, multifaceted, furthermore, moreover, pivotal, landscape, tapestry,
  underscore, foster, showcase, intricate, vibrant, fundamental, significant,
  interplay). No filler phrases ("here's the kicker", "the bottom line",
  "let me break this down").
- Every section earns its place: if a reader can't act on it or decide with
  it, cut it.
- Architecture docs (architecture/) cite file:line for every claim.
